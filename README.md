# Phantom Orchestration Playbooks - Repo for Phantom version 1.0

This is the 1.0 release repo for Phantom Community Playbooks.
If you are using Phantom version 1.0, you should update to the latest Phantom release.

As of Phantom version 1.2.265, the community repo is automatically updated to the 1.2 branch to provide you with the latest content.  You can update your content by periodically performing a sync in the Automation playbooks page.

If you are using Phantom version 1.1, you would only be seeing this repo if you upgraded from 1.0, and you should add a second community repo (community11 for example) with the following information.  Do not attempt to delete and re-add the main "community" repo.

* Repository name: community11
* URI: https://github.com/phantomcyber/playbooks.git
* Branch Name: 1.1
* Read Only: Checked
